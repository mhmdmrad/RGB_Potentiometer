# RGB_Potentiometer
Use a potentiometer to control an RGB LED with Arduino. Turning the potentiometer changes the LED color by adjusting the brightness of red, green, and blue channels. This project demonstrates analog input with the potentiometer and PWM output on the LED, creating various color mixes through different voltage levels.
